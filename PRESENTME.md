PresenterActivity in Android MVP
===============================
There are almost as many Android MVP patterns as there are Android applications. Most Android MVP Architectures implement the View
logic in the Activity. This doc makes the case for putting the view logic in custom view classes and use the Activity as
the Presenter.

Sample Implementations:
* [MockTrade](https://github.com/balch/MockTrade)
* [EBay Auction Browser](https://github.com/balch/AuctionBrowser)

### Other Android MVP Approaches

#### [Mosby MVP](http://hannesdorfmann.com/mosby/mvp/)
Mosby is an interesting Android MVP Framework that has a lot of cool functionality. I like that version
2.0 is leaner and meaner, and the ViewState and Loading-Content-Error features show they understand
the complexities of developing Android applications.

I found this quote which nicely describes their MVP philosophy:
> But before we dive deeper in how to implement MVP on Android we have to clarify if an Activity or
Fragment is a View or a Presenter. Activity and Fragment seems to be both, because they have
lifecycle callbacks like onCreate() or onDestroy() as well as responsibilities of View things
like switching from one UI widget to another UI widget (like showing a ProgressBar while loading
and then displaying a ListView with data). You may say that these sounds like an Activity or
Fragment is a Controller. However, we came to the conclusion that Activity and Fragment
should be treated as part of a (dumb) View and not as a Presenter. You will see why afterwards.

This quote asks the right question, but comes up with a different answer. They are correct
that the Activity/Fragment provide both Presenter and View methods and behavior, but, I would
argue that the View methods (mainly `.findViewById()`) are convenience methods that are most
useful for creating Android sample applications.

The `Activity.setContentView(View view)` is the primary example I use to make the case
that the view is conceptually separate from the Activity. The View is passed to the Activity and
held as a reference (by adding it to the Window object). Calls to `Activity.findViewById()`
are delegated to the stored View (since both View and Activity implement `.findViewById()`).
This same concept also applies to Fragments and is reinforced by the `Fragment.onCreateView()`
method which forces the Fragment derived class to create a separate view.

Storing another reference to the View in a separate Presenter class adds another level
of indirection: Activity (Lifecycle Events) --&gt; Presenter --&gt; View
(which is actually the Activity). I first tried this approach in an application using
complex Lifecycle Events tied to Loaders and `onActivityResult()`. I found the
Presenter eventually morphed into a subset of Activity Lifecycle Events codified into an
interface.

#### [GoogleSamples todo-mvp](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp/)

The GoogleSamples repo demonstrates another flavor of the MVP architecture where view logic is
implemented in the Fragment. The interesting part of this pattern is having the View and Presenter
interfaces defined in a Contract interface.

```java
// This specifies the contract between the view and the presenter.
public interface TasksContract {
    interface View extends BaseView<Presenter> {
        void setLoadingIndicator(boolean active);
        void showTasks(List<Task> tasks);
        void showAddTask();
        ...
    }

    interface Presenter extends BasePresenter {
        void result(int requestCode, int resultCode);
        void loadTasks(boolean forceUpdate);
        void addNewTask();
        ...
    }
}
```

I like the concept of a Presenter contract, but have implemented in a slightly diffent location
in the PresenterActivity pattern. Each View class defines an interface which must be implemented
by the caller. The interface allows the Presenter to handle events generated by the View and
is used to drive the View.

This pattern is demonstrated in code samples in the [View](#view) section.

### PresenterActivity
The Activity Lifecycle is the heart of any Android Application. It provides access to important
events that need to be handled to create a robust Android Application. In addition to the common
activity events (onCreate/OnDestroy, onStart/onPause, onResume/onPause), there are advanced events
(onActivityResult, onSaveInstanceState) which must be handled in most Android Applications.

When implemented separately from the Activity, a typlical Presenter class usually contains methods that
correspond directly to LifeCycle events. In addition, the Presenter base interfaces usually define
a subset of the Lifecycle methods which limits the Application in certain circumstances.

The `PresenterActivity` solves the problem in a unique way. The supported Activity LifeCycle
methods are wrapped and exposed to the Child class by using a `Base` naming convention.

**[Full PresenterActivity.java Source](https://github.com/balch/MockTrade/blob/develop/AppFramework/src/main/java/com/balch/android/app/framework/PresenterActivity.java)**

```java
public abstract class PresenterActivity<V extends View & BaseView, M extends ModelProvider>
                            extends AppCompatActivity  {

    /**
     * Override abstract method to create a view of type V used by the Presenter.
     * The view id will be managed by this class  if not specified
     * @return View containing view logic in the MVP pattern
     */
    protected abstract V createView();

    /**
     * Override abstract method to create any models needed by the Presenter. A class of type
     * M is injected into this method to take advantage the Dependency Injection pattern.
     * This mechanism is implemented by requiring the Application instance be of type M.

     * @param modelProvider injected ModelProvider
     */
    protected abstract void createModel(M modelProvider);

    // override-able activity functions
    public void onCreateBase(Bundle savedInstanceState) {}
    public void onResumeBase() {}
    public void onPauseBase() {}
    public void onStartBase() {}
    public void onStopBase() {}
    public void onDestroyBase() {}
    public void onSaveInstanceStateBase(Bundle outState) {}
    public void onActivityResultBase(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) { }
    public boolean onHandleException(String logMsg, Exception ex) {return false;}
    ...
    ...
    ...
}
```

This pattern enforces MVP by requireing implementers to specify View and ModelProvider types, and implement
`abstract V createView()` and `abstract void createModel(M modelProvider)` methods to create concreate classes
to represent the **MV** part of **MV**P. These methods are extremley usefull when it comes to [Unit Testing](#unit_testing).

The integration with the Android LifeCycle events provides a familiar set of methods to `@Override` and makes it easy to 
port legacy applications. The interaction with the LifeCycle events allows the framework to provide integrated error handling
and timing logs. 

### Model and ModelProvider
* Domain Objects
* ModelProvider
   * All Application Level Objects
       * Sql Connection
       * Http Connection
   * Facilitate Dependency Injection
* Model Interactors

### View
* Listener interface
   * acts as a mini-presenter
   * allows activity to call through models and set data in view
* Reusable to display data from other sources
* Con: damn &lt;merge&gt; tags
```java
public class AuctionView extends LinearLayout implements BaseView {
    ...
    ...
    public interface MainViewListener {
        boolean onLoadMore(int currentPage);
        void onChangeSort(int position);
        void onClickNoteButton(Auction auction);
        void onClickAuction(Auction auction);
        void onClickSearch(String keyword);
    }

    protected MainViewListener mainViewListener;

    public AuctionView(Context context) {
        super(context);
    }

    public AuctionView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
    }

    public AuctionView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle) {
        super(context, attrs, defStyle);
    }

    @Override
    public void initializeLayout() {
         inflate(getContext(), R.layout.auction_view, this);
         ...
    }

    public void setMainViewListener(MainViewListener mainViewListener) {
        this.mainViewListener = mainViewListener;
    }
    ...
    ...
}
```

```java
public class MainActivity extends PresenterActivity<AuctionView, AuctionModelProvider> {

    protected AuctionView auctionView;

    @VisibleForTesting EBayModel auctionModel;
    @VisibleForTesting NotesModel notesModel;

    @Override
    public void onCreateBase(Bundle bundle) {
        this.auctionView.setMainViewListener(this);
        this.auctionView.showBusy();
    }

    @Override
    public AuctionView createView() {
        auctionView = new AuctionView(this);
        return auctionView;
    }

    @Override
    protected void createModel(AuctionModelProvider modelProvider) {
        auctionModel = new EBayModel(getString(R.string.ebay_app_id), modelProvider);
        notesModel = new NotesModel(modelProvider);
    }

    ...
    ...
}
```

### Unit Testing
One of the stated benefits of MVP and Dependency Injection is improved testability. This
is accomplished through proper encapsulation into MVP classes and the ability to inject
mock versions of dependant classes to the code being tested. This is especially powerful
when combined with a mock framework like [Mockito](http://site.mockito.org/).

The `PresenterActivity` architecture facilitates unit testing with the minimal amount of
bypassing functionality with `doNothing().when()` calls. This is accomplished through a
combination of overriding the `createView()` method and injecting a `ModelProvider`
instance with the proper mocked application scoped objects. This technique is
demonstrated in the sample unit tests below.

The `PresenterActivity` also solves testing issues associated with the Android framework
itself. Many Android class implementations are not available in the testing framework
which causes many Activity tests to fail with not implemented exceptions.
This is typically solved through third-party testing frameworks that have TestRunners
that include a version of the Android runtime libraries
(I'm thinking of you [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/)).

The classes derived from `PresenterActivity` can be tested without these frameworks
because the mirrored Activity Lifecycle events do not call their super counterparts.
This makes writing reverse-engineered unit test a breeze (see
`testOnCreateBase()` below).

```java
public class MainActivityTest {

    @Mock AuctionView view;
    @Mock SqlConnection sqlConnection;
    @Mock LoaderManager loaderManager;

    private MainActivity activity;
    private AuctionModelProvider modelProvider;

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        initMocks(this);

        modelProvider = spy(new AuctionApplication() {
            @Override
            public SqlConnection getSqlConnection() {
                return sqlConnection;
            }
        });

        activity = spy(new MainActivity() {
            @Override
            public AuctionView createView() {
                auctionView = view;
                return auctionView;
            }
        });

        doReturn("").when(activity).getString(eq(R.string.ebay_app_id));
        doReturn(loaderManager).when(activity).getSupportLoaderManager();

        activity.createView();
        activity.createModel(modelProvider);
    }

    @Test
    public void testOnCreateBase() throws Exception {
        activity.onCreateBase(null);

        verify(view).setMainViewListener(eq(activity));
        verify(view).setSortStrings(eq(R.array.auction_sort_col));
        verify(view).showBusy();
        verify(loaderManager).initLoader(anyInt(), isNull(Bundle.class), eq(activity));
    }

    @Test
    public void testOnLoadMore() throws Exception {
        activity.totalPages = 5;
        activity.isLoadFinished = true;
        doNothing().when(activity).updateView();

        assertTrue(activity.onLoadMore(2));

        verify(view).showBusy();
        verify(activity).updateView();
    }

    @Test
    public void testOnLoadMoreNoMore() throws Exception {
        activity.totalPages = 5;
        activity.isLoadFinished = true;
        doNothing().when(activity).updateView();

        assertFalse(activity.onLoadMore(5));

        verify(view, never()).showBusy();
        verify(activity, never()).updateView();
    }

    @Test
    public void testSaveNote() throws Exception {
        Auction auction = mock(Auction.class);
        Note note = mock(Note.class);
        String text = "test text";

        activity.saveNote(auction, note, text);

        verify(note).setNote(eq(text));
        verify(sqlConnection).update(eq(activity.notesModel), eq(note));
    }

}
```
